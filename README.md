## Hi there!üëã

<img src="./developer.jpg" width="400" align="right" alt="https://pixabay.com/illustrations/developer-programmer-coding-8764521"/>

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a passionate .NET developer with experience in designing and building web applications. I love creating server-side solutions and enyoj in automating daily processes to streamline workflows.
<br/>Daily, I focus on implementing best practices and design patterns in the solutions I create, ensuring that code and functionality are covered by tests. I strive to write optimal code while maintaining readability.
<br/>My experience includes working with both monolithic and microservices architectures, utilizing GraphQL and REST APIs to build efficient and scalable systems.

‚úçÔ∏è I enjoy tackling Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and infrastructure challenges. My approach always centres around finding practical solutions. As a software engineer, I am most excited about exploring new tools and technologies. I am always eager to learn and implement them to improve my work. I am also a strong advocate of effective teamwork, which enables me to solve problems efficiently.

üè° When I'm not coding, I like to spend my free time actively. You can often find me running, and I always make sure to find time for my family.
